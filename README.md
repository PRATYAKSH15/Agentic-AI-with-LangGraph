# Agentic-AI-with-LangGraph

This repo showcases how to build **Agentic AI workflows** using **LangGraph**, **LangChain**, **FastAPI**, and modern **LLMs** (OpenAI API, Groq).  
It contains practical examples and projects for creating:

- 🧠 Intelligent agents with memory, reasoning, and tool usage  
- 🤝 Multi-agent collaboration & workflow orchestration  
- 📚 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agents  
- ⚡ Autonomous research assistants & task automation bots  
- 🌐 FastAPI backends to serve and deploy agent workflows  
- 🤖 LLM-powered applications with OpenAI (primary) and Groq (secondary)
